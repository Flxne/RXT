## Installation
You can use our installer and uninstaller files to install and uninstall the flags, but keep in mind this will not autoupdate, so you will need to run the installer again every time there is a Roblox update.

Download them [here](https://github.com/Flxne/RXT/releases/tag/Release) by clicking on Installer.cmd or Uninstaller.cmd.
